# Phase 5: Security & RBAC - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Step 1: Security Definer Functions
- `has_role()` and `is_admin()` functions already exist in database
- Granted execute permissions to authenticated users

### ✅ Step 2: RLS Policy Audit & Fixes
Fixed critical security vulnerabilities identified in scan:

**Profiles Table:**
- Restricted admin access to use `is_admin()` security definer
- Users can only view their own profile or admin can view all

**Restaurants Table:**
- Added explicit authentication requirement
- Prevented public read access to business data

**Audit Logs Table:**
- Strengthened policies to ensure users only see their own logs
- Admins can view all logs via `is_admin()` check

**User Roles Table:**
- Prevented role enumeration attacks
- Users can only view their own roles, not query others

**Cached Places Table:**
- Consolidated to single read-only public policy
- Removed redundant policies

### ✅ Step 3: Protected Route Component
Created `src/features/auth/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`:
- Checks authentication status
- Validates user roles
- Shows loading state during checks
- Redirects unauthorized users

### ✅ Step 4: Route Protection Applied
Protected routes:
- `/profile` - Requires authentication
- `/unauthorized` - New access denied page

### ✅ Step 5: Permission System
Created granular permission control:

**usePermissions Hook** (`src/features/auth/hooks/usePermissions.ts`):
- `can(action)` - Check if user has permission
- `cannot(action)` - Inverse check
- Permission matrix for all roles

**Can Component** (`src/features/auth/components/Can.tsx`):
- Declarative permission-based rendering
- Example: `<Can do="edit:menu"><Button /></Can>`

### ✅ Step 6: Removed (Security Risk)
Authorization interceptor was NOT implemented as it's a client-side security vulnerability.

## Security Status

### Remaining Warnings:
1. **Postgres Version** (WARN) - Requires manual upgrade in Supabase dashboard
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/upgrading

### Security Best Practices Applied:
✅ All authentication checks use server-side `auth.uid()`
✅ Role checks use security definer functions
✅ No client-side role/permission spoofing possible
✅ RLS policies prevent privilege escalation
✅ Explicit deny-by-default access control

## Usage Examples

### Protecting Routes:
```tsx
<ProtectedRoute requireAuth={true}>
  <ProfilePage />
</ProtectedRoute>

<ProtectedRoute requiredRole={['admin', 'moderator']}>
  <AdminDashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### Permission Checks:
```tsx
const { can } = usePermissions();

if (can('edit:menu')) {
  // Show edit button
}

<Can do="view:admin-panel" fallback={<AccessDenied />}>
  <AdminPanel />
</Can>
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Try accessing `/profile` without authentication → Redirects to `/auth`
- [ ] Try accessing protected route with wrong role → Shows `/unauthorized`
- [ ] Verify users cannot query other users' data in database
- [ ] Test permission-based UI rendering with different roles
- [ ] Upgrade Postgres version in Supabase dashboard
